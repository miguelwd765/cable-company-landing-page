# Cable Company Website :tv:

This is a website for a fictional cable company. I built this project using
vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also implemented the JavaScript library
**[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)** to assist me in making HTTP requests. I also used TV Maze's free API to create the show search section of this website. I also implemented **[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)** icons and images from **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)**.

Take a clooser look at the website **[here](https://miguelwd765.github.io/cable-company-landing-page/)**

### Key Features

- Utilizes API HTTP requests
- Dynamic HTML with HTTP request
- Mobile responsive üì±
